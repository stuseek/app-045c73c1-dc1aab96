# Implementation Plan

Development Plan for Simple Checklist App

1. Key files to create:
- Frontend:
  - src/App.js: Main React component
  - src/components/Checklist.js: Checklist component
  - src/components/ChecklistItem.js: Checklist item component
  - src/components/AddItemForm.js: Form to add new checklist item
  - src/api/checklistApi.js: API calls to backend
- Backend:
  - server.js: Express server entry point
  - routes/checklists.js: Checklist API routes
  - controllers/checklistController.js: Checklist controller functions
  - models/Checklist.js: Mongoose schema for Checklist
  - models/ChecklistItem.js: Mongoose schema for ChecklistItem
  - middleware/auth.js: Authentication middleware
  - config/db.js: MongoDB connection configuration

2. Main functions/classes/components to implement:
- Frontend React Components:
  - App: Top-level component, handles global state and routing
  - Checklist: Renders a single checklist with its items
  - ChecklistItem: Renders a single checklist item with toggle, edit, delete 
  - AddItemForm: Renders a form to add a new checklist item
- Backend Express Controllers and Models:
  - checklistController:
    - createChecklist: Create a new checklist
    - getChecklists: Get all checklists for a user  
    - getChecklist: Get a single checklist by ID
    - updateChecklist: Update a checklist by ID
    - deleteChecklist: Delete a checklist by ID
  - Checklist Model: Mongoose schema for Checklist
  - ChecklistItem Model: Mongoose schema for ChecklistItem

3. Technology stack:
- Frontend: React, HTML, CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js 
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

4. High-level architecture diagram (in text):

Client (Browser)
  |
  | HTTP Requests
  |
Server (Node.js/Express)
  |
  | Mongoose ODM
  |
Database (MongoDB)

The client (web browser) sends HTTP requests to the server. The server is built with Node.js and Express, and handles these requests using route handlers and controllers. The controllers interact with the MongoDB database using Mongoose ODM (Object Document Mapper) to perform CRUD operations on Checklists and ChecklistItems. The server sends responses back to the client, which then updates the React components to reflect the new state.

Authentication is handled using JWT. When a user logs in, a JWT is generated and sent to the client. The client includes this JWT in the headers of subsequent requests to authenticate the user. The server middleware verifies the JWT before allowing access to protected routes.

This architecture separates concerns and allows for a scalable and maintainable application. The React frontend handles user interaction and rendering, the Express backend handles business logic and data operations, and the MongoDB database provides data storage.
